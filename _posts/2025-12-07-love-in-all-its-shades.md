**Love.**  
It’s such a wild thing to feel, to believe in. Isn’t it something that drenches you in the chaos the world throws at you, and yet you don’t care? You’d rather wrap your arms around your better half, let them feel the dampness of your chaos, and allow them to be a part of it.

It’s funny how love always leaves a mark. A person can bring a breeze warm enough to lull you to sleep, yet suddenly you have a train to catch—and instead of tearing that ticket, you crumble into your own heart, overflowing with raw, unguarded love.

Sometimes you just want to hold their face with your bare hands because you want to gather as much of them as you can in the little time you have. And their smile? It’s pure gold.

Isn’t this the peace every human searches for on this planet?  
The peace I find when I see him unhinged, honest, raw. And it’s one of the most beautiful, quiet feelings—to find him and myself folding into each other, not in a “hey, I’m here for you,” but in a “hey, that show was fun.” It’s wordless, effortless. It writes its truth in the colour **white**.

People ask, *what colour is love?*  
I say:

- It is **red** for those who treasure the spark.  
- **Sparkly gold** for those who carve their love into a fairy tale.  
- **Light pink** for those who find their love soft and cheery, like Taylor Swift’s *Lover*.  
- **Midnight blue** for souls who love quietly, who find romance in simply sitting under the moonlight with tea in hand.  
- **Lavender** for those who love with gentleness, whose affection grows through small, steady gestures.  
- **Fiery orange** for those who love boldly, loudly, unashamedly.  
- And my favourite: **white**. For when you catch yourself smiling just by seeing him—no words exchanged, just raw respect.  
- And finally, for some, love is **colourless**, clear as water, because it reflects whoever we become when we give our hearts away.
