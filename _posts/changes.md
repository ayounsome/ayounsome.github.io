**Change is the only constant.**

I never thought something like this would happen between me and **Kartik**. I never imagined things would ever get better with **Rhea**. I didn’t expect my dynamic with **Juhi** to become this smooth. But that’s the thing about life—nothing stays the same. Everything changes.  
Sometimes slowly, sometimes abruptly. Sometimes so subtly you barely notice, and sometimes so harshly it knocks the wind out of you. The real challenge is learning to make peace with it. Abrupt change especially can take a toll.  

But in the middle of all this smoke and shifting ground, what is it that makes us believe things will eventually be alright? What is it that gives us the sense that peace *will* return?  
Has it always been faith? Has God been that one constant?

I feel like whatever God brings into our lives—whatever happens through the course of our journeys—we’re always having these small conversations with Him, even if we don’t realise it. We can’t see God, we can’t hear Him in the literal sense, but maybe that’s for the greater good. Maybe the distance gives us room to believe in the constancy of something bigger than us—something steady enough to help us accept whatever comes our way.

And then there is **time**.  
Uff, what do I even say about it?

In everything I’ve written above, time has been the measuring scale. But now, time itself deserves its own space. Time is powerful, isn’t it? Sometimes you have no choice but to wait for it to pass… and other times you desperately wish you could just stop it. When things slip beyond human control, that’s when we circle back to one thing—faith.

**Faith, indeed.**
