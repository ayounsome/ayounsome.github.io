It is funny how differently the world is perceived by the people around us. Some like writing their thoughts out like this. Some prefer sleeping over them. Some find it useful. Some even find it great. None of these ways are wrong, they are simply different responses to the same chaos.

Some people need a few Taylor Swift songs to listen to alone at night once they call it a day. Others do not really care about vibing over things. They would rather spend that time planning and figuring out what is still unsorted. One seeks comfort, the other seeks control. Maybe both are just trying to survive the same restlessness in their own way.

Some things feel cringe to certain people and not to others. And maybe the reason our past feels cringe is because it no longer belongs to who we are becoming. Growth has a way of making old versions of ourselves feel unfamiliar, even embarrassing. But without those versions, there would be no progress.

But that is not really my point.

What I am trying to say is that while people differ a lot in their ideologies, many of those differences exist simply because they grew up around different things. Different environments shape different instincts. What feels obvious to one person may feel foreign to another. And what we call opinion is often just conditioning wearing confidence.

I try not to be judgmental, and I hope for the same in return.

Peace.
